# MMMI

Start by compilate the file "MMMI.R", it will load every datas and plot some graphs of them.

Then, compilate the file "MMMI_model.R", it will write the equations and solve them with some random parameters.

The last file "MCMC.R" contains the metropolis-hastings algorithm, but I don't have time to finish it by adapting it for my model.

And the "modele.pdf", contains a representation of my model.

Be attention to be on the right folder which is the global one.
