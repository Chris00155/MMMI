# MMMI

Start by running the "MMMI.R" file, which will load all the data and plot a graph of it.

Next, run the "MMMI_model.R" file, which will write the equations and solve them with random parameters at first. Next, it will enter the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which will solve the equations with a slight perturbation of the initial parameters. Next, it will take all the thousands of parameters and write them to a csv file "samples.csv".

The "distrib.R" file will calculate several model solutions with different theta values.  

And the "modele.pdf" file contains a representation of my model.

Make sure you're on the right folder, which is the global folder.
